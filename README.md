## Challenges
- **Routing**: Figuring out how to direct users to the right page based on their URL was tough. It took some trial and error, but I'm glad I finally got it working!
- **Rendering CSS**: Getting the CSS styles to render properly was quite a hassle. I had to ensure that the server was correctly serving the CSS files and that they were linked to the HTML pages correctly.

## Learning Points
- **HTTP Module**: Learned how to use the Node.js HTTP module to create a web server and handle HTTP requests.
- **File System Module**: Explored the Node.js File System module to read HTML and CSS files from the file system.
- **Path Module**: Utilized the Node.js Path module to manipulate file paths and determine file extensions.
